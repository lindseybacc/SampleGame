Project Description

Movement Game is a text-based, choose-your-own-path adventure game written in Java. The objective is simple: find your way to the backyard to escape the Old House. Along the way, players can explore different rooms, pick up items, and earn bonus points.
How to Play

    Start the Game: When prompted, choose whether you want to enter the Old House by selecting the corresponding option.
    Explore the House: Once inside, you'll be navigating through various rooms. The game may provide you with options for movement or interaction within these rooms.
    Collect Items: Some rooms may contain items that you can pick up to earn bonus points. These points contribute to your final score.
    Reach the Backyard: Your goal is to find the backyard to escape the Old House. If you collect enough points (1000 or more), you'll successfully beat the game.
